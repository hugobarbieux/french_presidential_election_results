# French presidential election results

This code aims to retrieve the results for the French presidential election by local entity.

Frech Interior Ministry has released the results in the form of linked .xml files at [this address](https://www.resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/telechargements/PR2022/).

The code attached to this repo should give hints to batch download the results and assemble them in a unique .csv file.

Any suggestion of improvements welcome.

The code is also available as a Colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rLgVaxYjs4v3RzV1Q7jiNc3MVHu-QTue?usp=sharing
